Picosystemn is a tiny hackable pocket sized handheld games dev console with RP2040 at its heart.

This sample code is a minimal example for trying source code debugging in VSCode by connecting the Picosystem with a debug probe for Raspberry Pi Pico (rp2040).

It has been tested to work on Windows and macOS. On macOS, it works if you set up the official Raspberry PI Pico C++ development environment.

Windows is a bit trickier, and to debug using a debug probe, you need to set up your development environment according to the guide provided [here](https://shawnhymel.com/2096/how-to-set-up-raspberry-pi-pico-c-c-toolchain-on-windows-with-vs-code/). Note that we did not use the official Debug Probe from the Raspberry Pi Foundation, but instead, we used a regular Raspberry Pi Pico with a program written for the debug probe.
